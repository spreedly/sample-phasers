  <p>
    This is a sample application designed to demonstrate how to use <%= link_to "Spreedly", "https://spreedly.com" %> to collect money for one-off purchases using credit cards.
  </p>

  <p>It uses the <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty">httparty</a> gem to talk to the Spreedly API.</p>

  <p>
    It's all <a href="https://github.com/spreedly/sample-phasers">open source and on Github</a> for you to use.  We also have a number of <a href="https://docs.spreedly.com/resources/apps-libs/">other sample applications</a> you might find useful.
